EPI5143 Winter 2020 Quiz 6.
Due Tuesday March 31st at 11:59PM via Github (link will be provided)

Using the Nencounter table from the class data:
a) How many patients had at least 1 inpatient encounter that started in 2003?

1075 patients had one inpatient that occurred in 2003. 
Code: 
libname ldata "/folders/myfolders/class_data"; 
libname ex '/folders/myfolders/Epi work folder/data';

data ex.nencounter ; *new data set that is a copy from ldata (set); 
set ldata.nencounter; 
run; 

data ex.nencounter;  *creating variable for year of start of admission;
set ex.nencounter; 
year=year(datepart(EncStartDtm)); 
run; 

data ex.nencounter; *creating data set including just the year 2003; 
set ex.nencounter; 
if year ne 2003 then delete; 
run; 

data ex.nencounter; *making flag for inpatient encouunters; 
set ex.nencounter; 
inpatient=0; 
if EncVisitTypeCd= "INPT" then inpatient=1; 
run; 

proc freq data=ex.nencounter; *making sure my flag worked; 
table inpatient; 
run; 

proc means data=ex.nencounter; *flat filing by EncPatWID;
class EncPatWID; 
var inpatient; 
output out=inpatient2 max(inpatient)=inpatient n(inpatient)=count; 
run; 

proc freq data=inpatient2;
tables inpatient count; 
run; 

proc sort data=inpatient2 nodupkey; *ensuring no duplicate EncPatwid; 
by EncPatwid; 
run; 

b) How many patients had at least 1 emergency room encounter that started in 2003? 
There were 1979 patients with an emergency room encounter that started in 2003. 

Code: 
data ex.nencounter; *nencounter had already been filtered as part of question one to only include visits in 2003; 
set ex.nencounter; 
emergency=0; 
if EncVisitTypeCd= "EMERG" then emergency=1; 
run; 

proc freq data=ex.nencounter; 
table emergency; 
run; 

proc means data=ex.nencounter; *flat filing by EncPatWID;
class EncPatWID; 
var emergency; 
output out=emergency2 max(emergency)=emergency n(emergency)=count; 
run; 

proc freq data=emergency2;
tables emergency count; 
run; 

c) How many patients had at least 1 visit of either type (inpatient or emergency room encounter) that started in 2003?
2892 patients had at least one visit of either type that started in 2003. 

libname ldata "/folders/myfolders/class_data"; 
libname ex '/folders/myfolders/Epi work folder/data';

data ex.nencounter ; *new data set that is a copy from ldata (set); 
set ldata.nencounter; 
run; 

data ex.nencounter;  *creating variable for year of start of admission;
set ex.nencounter; 
year=year(datepart(EncStartDtm)); 
run; 

data ex.nencounter; *creating data set including just the year 2003; 
set ex.nencounter; 
if year ne 2003 then delete; 
run; 

data ex.nencounter; *making flag for either encounter; 
set ex.nencounter; 
both=0;
if EncVisitTypeCd= "INPT" then both=1; 
if EncVisitTypeCd= "EMERG" then both=1;
run; 

proc means data=ex.nencounter; *flat filing by EncPatWID;
class EncPatWID; 
var both; 
output out=both2 max(both)=both n(both)=count; 
run; 

proc freq data=both2;
tables both count; 
run; 

proc sort data=both2 nodupkey; *ensuring no duplicate EncPatwid; 
by EncPatwid; 
run; 

d) In patients from c) who had at least 1 visit of either type, create a variable that counts the total number encounters (of either type)-for example, a patient with one inpatient encounter and one emergency room encounter would have a total encounter count of 2. Generate a frequency table of total encounter number for this data set, and paste the (text) table into your assignment- use the SAS tip from class to make the table output text-friendly
ie: 
options formchar="|----|+|---+=|-/\<>*"; 

Code: 
proc means data=ex.nencounter; *flat filing by EncPatWID;
class EncPatWID; 
var both; 
output out=both2 max(both)=both n(both)=count; *count variable included for either inpatient or emergency visit;
run; 

options formchar="|----|+|---+=|-/\<>*"; *format table;

proc freq data=both2;
tables count; 
run; 


count	Frequency	Percent	Cumulative
Frequency	Cumulative
Percent
1	2556	88.38	2556	88.38
2	270	9.34	2826	97.72
3	45	1.56	2871	99.27
4	14	0.48	2885	99.76
5	3	0.10	2888	99.86
6	1	0.03	2889	99.90
7	1	0.03	2890	99.93
12	1	0.03	2891	99.97
3327	1	0.03	2892	100.00


Additional Info/hints
-you only need to use the NENCOUNTER table for this question 
-EncWID uniquely identifies encounters
-EncPatWID uniquely identifies patients
-Use EncStartDtm to identify encounters occurring in 2003
-EncVisitTypeCd identifies encounter types (EMERG/INPT)

-You will need to flatfile to end up 1 row per patient id, and decide on a strategy to count inpatient, emerg and total encounters for each patient to answer each part of the assignment. 
-There are many ways to accomplish these tasks. You could create one final dataset that can be used to answer all of a) through d), or you may wish to create different datasets/use different approaches to answer different parts. Choose an approach you are most comfortable with, and include lots of comments with your SAS code to describe what your code is doing (makes part marks easier to award and a good practice regardless).

Please submit your solutions through Github as a plain text .sas or .txt file.
